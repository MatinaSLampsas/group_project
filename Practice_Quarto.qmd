```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)


```

```{r}


```

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
life_exp
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
